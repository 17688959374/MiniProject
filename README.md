# MiniProject
A mini ros project about moveit and gazebo simulation for interviewing
if you want to run this project, fistly run the launch file: arm_bringup_moveit.launch  in the mini_launch/launch and than in the rivz you can add motionplanning to do some motion plan and than the resualt will show in the gazebo.
I also write a controller in the mini_controller/py. By modifying the coordinatiton in the moveit_demo.py you can move the arm by yourself.
Another tip is that in the arm_world.launch I use the empty_world.launch from gazebo. This may create some bugs in others computer.
