# MiniProject
A mini ros project about moveit and gazebo simulation for interviewing
if you want to run this project, fistly run the launch file: arm_bringup_moveit.launch  in the mini_launch/launch and than in the rivz you can add motionplanning.
I also write a controller in the mini_controller/py. By modifying the coordinatiton in the moveit_demo.py you can move the arm.
